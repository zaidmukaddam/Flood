# FLOOD
Flood is a DDoS(Destributed denail of service) tool which can exploit some of the most popular DoS/
DDoS attacks.
# Features flood v0.0.1
* It Supports HTTP GET request flood DoS attack.
* It Supports ICMP ping request flood DDoS attack.
* It Supports TCP SYN flood DDoS attack.
* It Supports TCP PSH+ACK flood DDoS attack.
* It Supports UDP flood DoS attack.
* It uses spoofed source IP for the ICMP, SYN and PSH+ACK flood DDoS attack.
* It Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for all the attacks excluding the HTTP GET flood.
* It's Simple and easy to use, it allows you to use wizard if you find the commands hard remember.

# Commands
```
Usage: python3 flood [OPTIONS]
flood version: 0.0.1
ATTACKS:
--get-flood                Perform the HTTP GET request flood DoS attack.
--icmp-flood               Perform the ping ICMP flood DDoS attack.
--psh-flood                Perform the TCP PSH+ACK flood DDoS attack.
--syn-flood                Perform the TCP SYN flood DDoS attack.
--udp-flood                Perform the UDP flood DDoS attack.
HTTP flood:
-u,  --url                 Specify the URL to attack.
-p,  --port                Specify the port number for the HTTP GET reuqest flood.
GENERAL OPTIONS:
-t,  --target              Specify the target IP address/hostname.
-s,  --source              Specify a file path containing any number of spoofed source 
                            IP addresses(one per line) of this option is only available for the ICMP, 
                            TCP PSH+ACK, TCP SYN flood attacks, check the generating source IP
                            section. 
-n,  --packets             Specify the number of packets to send or Number of GET
                            requests to send for the HTTP GET request flood.
GENERATING SOURCE IP(s):
-g,  --generate            Use this option to specify the IP address of the network
                            for generating spoofed source IP(s), you can specify many ip addresses 
                            with
                            comma(,) seperated without white space.
-o,  --write               Specify the name of the output file to write the IP addresses. 
MISCELLANEOUS/MISC:
These options doesn't fit any of the category
-w,  --wizard              Use a simple wizard interface to help for beginner users.
-h,  --help                Print this help massage and exit.
-v,  --version             Print program version and exit.
```
# The --help Command
The '-h' or '--help' command just prints out the help massage and exit.
# Generating spoofed source IP
Some of the attacks requires that you specify a file containing IP addresses. The Idea is to use 
those IP addresses to spoofed the source IP address so that the target host will be sending responses 
to a falsified IP address.
The '-g'/'--generate' command help you to generate the IP address then use it with the '-o'/'--write' 
argument to write the output to the file name given.
* Example:
```
./flood.py -g 127.0.0.1 -o /home/user/source_ip.txt
```
You can also specify more than one IP address with comma(,) seperated.(without white space)
* Example2:
```
./flood -g 127.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,192.168.43.3 --write /home/user/source_ip.txt
```

# The --wizard Command
The '-w' or '--wizard' commands can be used to launch the UI which will guide you to perform your 
desired task. this is useful if you find the commands quite difficult to remember!.
* Example:
```
./flood.py --wizard
```
# --get-flood command
The --get-flood command is used for performing HTTP GET flood DoS attack.
* Arguments
Use the '-u' or '--url' flag to specify the target(or website) URL.
Use the '-p' or '--port' flag to specify the port number of the attack. This is optional, if not 
specified then flood will default to port 80.
Use the '-n' or '--packets' flag to specify the number of requests to send. This argument is required
for all the attacks.
* Example:
```
./flood.py --url URL -n 12500 --get-flood
```
# --icmp-flood command
The --icmp-flood command is use for exploiting the ICMP ping flood DDoS attack.
* Arguments
Use the '-t' or '--target' to specify the target's hostname or IP address.
Use the '-s' or '--source' to specify a file contaning spoofed source IP addresses, This argument is
required for all the attacks excluding the HTTP GET flood and UDP flood attacks.
* Example:
```
./flood.py --icmp-flood -t 127.0.0.1 -s /home/user/source.txt --packets 1920000
```
# --psh-flood command
This command is use for exploiting the TCP PSH+ACK flood DDoS attack.
* Example:
```
./flood.py --psh-flood -t 127.0.0.1 --port 80 -s /home/user/source.txt -n 192000
```
# --syn-flood command
This command is use for exploiting the TCP SYN flood DDoS attack.
* Example:
```
./flood.py -n 19200 -p 80 -t 127.0.0.1 -s /home/user/source.txt --syn-flood
```
# --udp-flood command
This command is use for flooding the target host with UDP packets.
It accepts only 2 arguments.
* Example:
```
./flood.py --target 127.0.0.1 --packets 192002 --udp-flood
```
